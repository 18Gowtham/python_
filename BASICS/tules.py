#tuples are a kind of data types 
#tuples r immutable
#tuples are faster

tup = (1,2,3,4)

print(tup[1]) #prints the value on index

#tup[1] = 4 #gives an error coz value cant be changed




#SETS
s = {1,2,3,7,23}
print(s) #can giv the output in diff order 
#repeated elements will not be included in output
#set never follows a sequence
#sequence changes
